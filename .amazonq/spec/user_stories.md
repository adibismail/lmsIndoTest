**I want to** view detailed user analytics  
**So that** I can understand user behavior patterns  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Analytics page shows user login trends
- Event data displayed in charts/tables
- Filter by date range and event type
- Export analytics data to CSV
- Complex queries execute within 5 seconds

### US-006: Product Management

- Foreign key relationships maintained
- JSONB data structure preserved
- UUID values remain consistent

### US-009: Performance Comparison
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** compare query performance  
**So that** I can validate upgrade benefits  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Benchmark queries run on both PostgreSQL versions
- Execution times recorded and compared
- Performance improvements documented
- Regression issues identified and addressed

### US-010: Application Compatibility
**As a** developer  
**I want to** ensure application works with PostgreSQL 17  
**So that** users experience no disruption  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
